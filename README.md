# Note: 
This is currently not recommended for use on Kali. Since GTK has moved on in versions I've not found an acceptable looking and functional theme for Kali that I've wanted to use with it. So I stopped updating it and moved off of Kali Linux.

Kali Post-Install
-----------------

A script to more easily setup a new Kali 2016 + w/Mate theme and additional tools installed.

Added add-to-panel.py which just simplifies adding bulk shortcuts to the Kali Mate top panel like in Kali 1.0 days :)

Tweet @CTFKris for ideas.

### Changelog

#### v2016.2

- Updated for Kali 2016.2 including GTK3.20 support.
- **Note**: GTK3.21 probably breaks the theme but is in the Kali rolling repo already. Be careful if running a apt-get upgrade.
