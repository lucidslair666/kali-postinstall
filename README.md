Kali Post-Install
-----------------

A script to more easily setup a new Kali 2016 + w/Mate theme and additional tools installed.

Added add-to-panel.py which just simplifies adding bulk shortcuts to the Kali Mate top panel like in Kali 1.0 days :)

Tweet @CTFKris for ideas.

### Changelog

#### v2016.2

- Updated for Kali 2016.2 including GTK3.20 support.
- **Note**: GTK3.21 probably breaks the theme but is in the Kali rolling repo already. Be careful if running a apt-get upgrade.
